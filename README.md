# Lucy's Lucky Lambs

This is a 3D video game, built by our team of 4 students for Stanford's CS194 project class.

In the game, you play the role of a shepherd-magician, leading your flock of sheep from one end of the game's treacherous landscape to the other. Along the way, you'll have to use your wits - and your trusty firebolt spell - to fight off the wolves who want to eat your sheep, and to shoot down the flying saucers trying to abduct them. Perhaps your biggest challenge will be directing your flock, who'll hop around chaotically and follow the herd instead of thinking for themselves. Using spells to light waypoints or build walls, you'll corral all your sheep (or at least, those that survived) into a portal to the next level. Check out our [picture slide deck](photos/slides.pdf) for some screenshots and a broad overview of the game's features.

We used Unity as our game engine, and Blender to build custom 3D models. We implemented a force-based [boid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) flocking AI for our sheep, to create a lifelike hopping herd, with sheep whose behavior is just frustrating enough to be fun. The wolves and UFOs have AI structured as finite state machines, giving them specific behaviors appropriate to in-game events - picking a sheep to chase after, then eating or abducting it, but stopping to attack the player if he tries to stop them, and dodging the player's fireballs. The game has a save system, and a multiple-choice dialog system, letting us weave a narrative through multiple levels. The player is given an HUD, showing the spells available, health and mana bars, and a health bar for every wounded NPC.

For more information on how we implemented the game, see our [documentation](https://github.com/leonl0000/LucysLuckyLambs/blob/master/Documentation/Documentation.md), which links to specific source code files.
