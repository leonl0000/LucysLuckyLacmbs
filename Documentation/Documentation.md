# Welcome

  Hello, NEW_HIRE_FIRST_NAME, welcome to EmuGames! On our first major project, Luci's Lucky Lambs, we are creating a game about a shepherd leading sheep through various obstacles, all on behalf of his old friend Luci\[fer\]. 
  
  To get started, you will need to know the basics of Unity. First, either show us some prior work in Unity, or follow this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL">tutorial by Brackeys</a>, and make the build the tutorial level in there with at least *one unique, creative addition*.

  

# Code overview

  The current version of the game is a Unity project stored in the  <a href='https://github.com/StanfordCS194/EmuGames/tree/master/prototypes/Quick%20Prototype'>Quick Prototype</a> folder.
  However, the majority of the files in this folder should not be edited directly; they are automatically created by the Unity editor, and changes should by made by opening and modifying the game in the Unity editor.
  The bulk of the code which we wrote manually for the game objects is located in the <a href='https://github.com/StanfordCS194/EmuGames/tree/master/prototypes/Quick%20Prototype/Assets/Scripts'>scripts folder</a>, organized by category.
  After learning Unity, you'll be all set and ready to work on this code. It is organized into 6 folders, representing the 6 main features of the game, described below.

- <a href="https://github.com/StanfordCS194/EmuGames/blob/master/Documentation/Player.md">The player</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/StanfordCS194/EmuGames/blob/master/Documentation/NPCs.md">The non-player characters (NPCs)</a>, including both the sheep and the enemy NPCs.
- <a href="https://github.com/StanfordCS194/EmuGames/blob/master/Documentation/Environment.md">The environment</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/StanfordCS194/EmuGames/blob/master/Documentation/Dialogue.md">Story and dialogue</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/StanfordCS194/EmuGames/blob/master/Documentation/System.md">System scripts</a>

Lastly, below is a record of most of our brainstorming sessions and early demo clips so you can see how the game shaped along from an empty plane with a sphere shepherd and capsule sheep to the growing game it is today.
